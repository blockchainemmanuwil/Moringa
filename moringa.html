        <p>Moringa has been named "The Miracle Tree", "The Tree of Life” and “Mother’s Milk.”. It has these names because the amazing benifits it has on the body. This nutrient-dense superfood has been used consistently in Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years, so why isn't it on more people’s radar?</p>
        <br>

        <p>So what is that’s so special about the moringa tree?  Moringa oleifera, also known as the drumstick tree or horseradish tree, is a fast-growing, drought-resistant tree native to the southern foothills of the Himalayas in northwestern India. It can reach a height of 10–12m, it has fragile branches, delicate, feathery leaves and long, three-sided seed pods which hang down in clusters.</p>

            <h2>Are There Health Benefits?</h2>
            <p>
                The short answers is yes! Moringa is stated to have 7 times as much vitamin C as Oranges. 
                4 times as much Vitamin A as oranges.
                If you dont drink cow milk just drink some moringa tea or put the powder in a smoothie beacuse it has 4 times as much Calcium as milk.
                It has the 3 times the potassium as bananas and 3 times the protien as yogart. Overall this is a great super food to add to your daily diet.
